- A 'coda' is a musical term for the end of a piece of music
- Kill 'codas' to keep your 'song' alive 
- If you die, your 'song' ends
- The longer you survive, the more 'codas' you will have to kill
- Keep your piece playing and harmonizing for as long as possible
- Killing codas adds points to your harmony score
- The higher your harmony score, the more points you get for killing codas
  - Your harmony is basically a combo multiplier
